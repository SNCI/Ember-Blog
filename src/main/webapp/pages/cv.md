Curriculum Vitae
================

My name is Joachim Haagen Skeie. On a daily basis I work as a senior IT consultant at [Kantega](http://www.kantega.no/). I hold a Masters degree in Information Technology from Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia.

Professionaly, I have worked as a Software Engineer since july 2006 in various positions ranging from developer, Scrum Master and Software Architect, primarily working on large-scale Java applications. I have received very good feedback from both colleagues, leaders and customers, as can be seen from my LinkedIn profile.

I am a strong believer in Open Source, and are involved as a committer to a number of Open Source projects:

- [EurekaJ Profiler](http://eurekaj.haagen.name/) – A Profiling tool for Java applications, integrated with BTrace
- [BTrace](http://kenai.com/projects/btrace) – A safe, dynamic tracing tool for the Java platform.
- [JSFlot](http://code.google.com/p/jsflot) – A JavaServer Faces charting library based on Flotr
- [JWireReplay](https://github.com/joachimhs/JWireReplay) – JWireReplay will be a tool that is able to replay HTTP traffic that is captured with the tool tcpdump.

I am also a board member of [JavaBin](http://www.java.no) – The Java User Group in Norway.
